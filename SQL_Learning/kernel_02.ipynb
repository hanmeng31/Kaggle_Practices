For this explanation, we'll use this imaginary database, `pet_records` which has just one table in it, called `pets`, which looks like this:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Ef4Puo3.png)\n\n### SELECT ... FROM\n___\n\nThe most basic SQL query is to select a single column from a specific table. To do this, you need to tell SELECT which column to select and then specify what table that column is from using from. \n\n> **Do you need to capitalize SELECT and FROM?** No, SQL doesn't care about capitalization. However, it's customary to capitalize your SQL commands and it makes your queries a bit easier to read.\n\nSo, if we wanted to select the \"Name\" column from the pets table of the pet_records database (if that database were accessible as a BigQuery dataset on Kaggle , which it is not, because I made it up), we would do this:\n\n    SELECT Name\n    FROM `bigquery-public-data.pet_records.pets`\n\nWhich would return the highlighted data from this figure.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/8FdVyFP.png)\n\n### WHERE ...\n___\n\nWhen you're working with BigQuery datasets, you'll usually want to return only certain rows, usually based on the value of a different column. You can do this using the WHERE clause, which will only return the rows where the WHERE clause evaluates to true.\n\nLet's look at an example:\n\n    SELECT Name\n    FROM `bigquery-public-data.pet_records.pets`\n    WHERE Animal = \"Cat\"\n\nThis query will only return the entries from the \"Name\" column that are in rows where the \"Animal\" column has the text \"Cat\" in it. Those are the cells highlighted in blue in this figure:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Va52Qdl.png)\n"
