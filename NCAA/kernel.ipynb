Weighing in at 3TB total, you can see how it would be easy for me to quickly exhaust my 5TB/30-day quota scanning lots of large tables. \n\nThe `bq_helper` module simplifies the common read-only tasks we can do using the BigQuery Python client library on Kaggle and makes it a cinch to manage resource usage. This helper class works only in Kernels because we handle authentication on our side. This means you don't need to worry about anything like managing credentials or entering in credit card information to have fun learning how to work with BigQuery datasets.\n\nYou'll learn how to do the following:\n\n1. Create a `BigQueryHelper` object\n2. Understand the tables in the dataset\n3. Estimate the size of your queries before you make them\n4. Query safely, convert to `pandas.dataframe`, and visualize results\n\nBy the end of this kernel, you'll not only learn a lot about querying BigQuery datasets safely, but we'll also find out the most popular licenses used by open source projects on GitHub. Let's go!"

We're eager to start analyzing the GitHub BigQuery dataset to uncover insights into open source software development, but we should be careful about how much data we scan in our queries. Let's make those free 5TB count!\n\nFortunately, the `bq_helper` module gives us tools to very easily estimate the size of our queries before we get ahead of ourselves. We simply write a `QUERY` using BigQuery's Standard SQL syntax then call the `estimate_query_size` function which will return the size of the query in GB. Let's give it a try.\n\n[In this kernel](https://www.kaggle.com/mrisdal/github-commit-messages), I wrote a query which `SELECTS` 2000 rather short commit messages from the `commits` table. Let's use `estimate_query_size` to see how much data it scans."

When you _do_ make a query request, your results will be cached for some time by default. So as long as you're in the same interactive notebook session, you can run the same cell/query multiple times without expending multiples of the quota cost. Whew! This is especially helpful because when you click \"New Snapshot\" to save your work, your kernel will be freshly executed from top to bottom.\n\n### Executing queries safely\n\nNow that we're comfortable with the huge amounts of data at our fingertips and know we can confidently estimate the size of our queries, let's actually fetch some data!\n\nThe `query_to_pandas_safe` function is another `bq_helper` function that makes the call to execute our query.

I know I felt confident about exploring this massive 3TB dataset knowing the functions available to me in `bq_helper` would prevent me from accidentally exceeding my quota. Here are some additional resources for working with BigQuery datasets in Kaggle Kernels:\n\n* New to SQL? Learn this practical language by signing up for our [5-day SQL Scavenger Hunt](https://www.kaggle.com/sql-scavenger-hunt) which starts February 15th\n* [A collection of all BigQuery resources on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/product-feedback/48573)\n* [Learn more about the BigQuery Python client library here](https://www.kaggle.com/sohier/beyond-queries-exploring-the-bigquery-api)\n* Explore [all BigQuery datasets available on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets?filetype=bigQuery)--each has its own \"starter kernel\" for you to fork"
